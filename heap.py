# Heap
# 
# A Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
# Max Heap: In a Max Heap, the key of each node is always greater than the keys of its child nodes, making the root node's key the largest in the heap.
# Min Heap: In a Min Heap, the key of each node is always smaller than the keys of its child nodes, resulting in the root node's key being the smallest in the heap.
