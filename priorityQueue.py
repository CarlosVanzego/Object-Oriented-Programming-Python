# Priority Queue
# 
# A priority queue is a data structure where each element is assigned a priority.
# Elements with higher priority are served before elements with lower priority.
# If elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.
# Basic operations of a priority queue are inserting, removing, and peeking elements.
# It is used for load balancing and interrupt handling in an operating system.
