# Funcitons are predefined tasks created by the programmer to be used later in the program.
# They help in breaking down the program into smaller chunks, making the code more organized and reusable.
# For example you can write a function to draw a square and then call this function whenever you need to draw a square, instead of writing the square-drawing code each time.
# Ex.

def draw_square():
    print("Drawing a square")

    draw_square()
