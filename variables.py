# In Python a variable is a container that stores a valule. The value can be a string, integer, float, boolean, etc.

# this is a variable I created called "x" inside it I stored the value 'Los'. By doing this I am making the "x" variable of type str (string).
x = 'Los'
y = 'Carlos'
# this is another variable, I called this one "a" and stored the value 4. By doing this I am making "4" of type int (integer).
a = 4
b = 8

# this is a print statement I am using to print the values of variable "X" and variable "a"
print(x,a)
print(y,b)




# Python infers the variable type since it is a dynamically-typed langauge.
