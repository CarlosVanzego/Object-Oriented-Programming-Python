# In Python a variable is a container that stores a value. The value can be a string, integer, float, boolean, etc.

# this is a variable I created called "x" inside it I stored the value 'Los'. By doing this I am making the "x" variable of type str (string). Then I created more variables and stored values in them.
x = 'Los'
y = 'Carlos'
z = 'Texas'
u = 'copilot'
i = 'value'
p = 'plant'
b = 'boxing'
t = 'type'
f = 'fly'
# This varaible "F" is a constant, you know this because I used a capital letter to name the variable. When this is done, it is using a naming convention that indicates that the variable should be treated as a constant and not changed. Then I created more constant variables and assigned them values.
H = 'Houston'
G = 'mouse'
T = 'pass'
O = 'Orange'
W = 'Workout'
B = 'Blue'
S = 'Southwest'
# this is another variable, I called this one "a" and stored the value 4. By doing this I am making "4" of type int (integer). Then I created more variables and stored values in them.
a = 4
c = 12
d = 9
A = 'alchemist'
Z = 'zero'
P = 'pushin'
F = 'february'
rand = 'value'
AIR = 'AIRLINES'
# Here I created the constatnt variable 'D' and assigned it the boolean value "True".
D = True
# this is a print statement I am using to print the values of the above variables.
print(F)
print(A)
print(z, H, B)
print(u, G, Z)
print(i, T, c, P)
print(p, O, D)
print(b, W, d, F)
print(rand, B, t)
print('f', 'S', 'AIR')



# Python infers the variable type since it is a dynamically-typed langauge.
