# In Python a variable is a container that stores a value. The value can be a string, integer, float, boolean, etc.

# this is a variable I created called "x" inside it I stored the value 'Los'. By doing this I am making the "x" variable of type str (string). Then I created more variables and stored values in them.
x = 'Los'
y = 'Carlos'
z = 'Texas'
u = 'copilot'
i = 'value'
# This varaible "F" is a constant, you know this because I used a capital letter to name the variable. When this is done it is using a naming convention that indicates that the variable should be treated as a constant and not changed. Then I created more constants.
F = 'Full Metal'
H = 'Houston'
G = 'mouse'
T = 'pass'
# this is another variable, I called this one "a" and stored the value 4. By doing this I am making "4" of type int (integer). Then I created more variables and stored values in them.
a = 4
b = 8
c = 12
A = 'alchemist'
B = 'brotherhood'
Z = 'zero'
P = 'pushin'
# this is a print statement I am using to print the values of the above variables.
print(F)
print(A)
print(z, H, B)
print(u, G, Z)
print(i, T, c, P)




# Python infers the variable type since it is a dynamically-typed langauge.
