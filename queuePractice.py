# Queue
# 
# A Queue is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes an element from the queue.
# First in, first out data structure (FIFO): the oldest added object is the first to be removed.

# Basic operations of Queue in Python
# put() - Inserts element to the end of the queue.
# get() - Removes an element from the start of the queue.
# empty() - Returns true if queue is empty.

# Time Complexity
# Access - O(n)
# Search - O(n)
# Insert - O(1)
# Remove - O(1)
