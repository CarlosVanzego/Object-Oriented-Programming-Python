# Tuples 
# 
# A tuple is similar to a list but, the main difference is that it's immutable once it's created. You cannot add or remove items in a tuple once you create it.
# Tuples are typically used when you want the data to remain unchanged throughout the program. It can be indexed just like a list and can have duplicates. It can hold multiple data types as well.
# To create a Tuple, elements are placed inside these circular parentheses()
 
# Creating a tuple:
#
sampleTuple = ("LeBron", "Jordan", "Curry")

print(sampleTuple)

# Tuple Length:
sampleTuple2 = ("Luka", "Kyrie", "Anthony")

print(len(sampleTuple2))

# Accessing tuple elements:
sampleTuple3 = ("Kobe", "Dennis", "Shaq")

print(sampleTuple3[0])
