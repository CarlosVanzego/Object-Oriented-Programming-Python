# While Loop
# 
# With the while loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# Ex.
# 
# I initialized the variable 'c' with a value.
c = 100
# I created a while loop that runs as long a 'c' is less than another value.
while c < 110:
  # Inside the loop, I print the current value of 'c'.
  print(c)
  # I then increment 'c' by 2 each iteration, stopping before it reaches 108.
  c += 2
